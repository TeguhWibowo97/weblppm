                                of Educations, Research and Community Services. Those three missions are inseparable
                                and lead to the convergence of the state of the art to the body of knowledge,
                                science and technology. Dian Nuswantoro is committed to fostering its research and
                                disseminates it as a form of community services to the society at large. Aside from
                                the said missions, we also serve to facilitate and foster the enrollment of
                                Intellectual Property Rights (I.P.R) to the Directorate General of Intellectual
                                Property Rights, Ministry of Law and Human Rights.
                                <br><br>Dian Nuswantoro University has been striving to improve its core competences
                                particularly in first, the development of creative industry, art and rich Javanese
                                culture, second, the development of information and communication technology (I.C.T)
                                for educations, society and government, third, the development of e-health and
                                health technology. Those three aspects are underpinned by the development of
                                sustainable social, economy and technology. We are committed to developing
                                environmental friendly based social, economy and technology, by putting emphasis on
                                local wisdom, cultural heritage, and Javanese cultural richness for instance
                                e-gamelan and natural dyes-based batik.
                                Dian Nuswantoro University is an open and broad-minded university that gets involved
                                tie-up, alliances, and relations with foreign universities from various countries.
